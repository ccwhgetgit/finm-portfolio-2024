    "#### Implications of Cross-Sectional MAE being Lower:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Focus on Cross-Sectional Analysis: The model is likely better suited for applications that rely on understanding the differences in average returns across assets, such as asset pricing or portfolio construction based on risk premiums.\n",
    "##### Less Reliable for Time-Series Forecasting: If you're looking to use this model for predicting future returns or understanding time-varying dynamics (e.g., tactical asset allocation), the higher time-series MAE suggests it may be less effective. It might not capture ##### market timing or short-term fluctuations as well.\n",
    "##### Factor Effectiveness: This outcome can indicate that the factors in the model are stronger explanatory variables in a cross-sectional context (explaining why some assets have higher or lower average returns) than in a time-series context (explaining fluctuations within each asset's return over time).\n",
    "##### Example Context:\n",
    "For instance, the Fama-French 5-Factor (FF5) model often performs well in cross-sectional tests because it captures broad asset characteristics (like size, value, and profitability) that distinguish returns across different stocks. However, it might not track each stockâ€™s return changes over time as accurately, because those factors don't capture all time-specific risks or behaviors affecting returns day-to-day or month-to-month."
